Examples
========

> The examples in this section:
>  - use the XML attribute version of the processors, but can just as easily be
>    swapped for their HTML data attribute equivalents if that's more your style
>  - assume that the Thymeleaf template engine is configured with `.html` as a
>    suffix.  This is the default in a lot of framework configurations, such as
>    Spring Boot.
