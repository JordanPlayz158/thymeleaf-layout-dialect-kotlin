title-pattern
=============

 - XML attribute: `layout:title-pattern`
 - Data attribute: `data-layout-title-pattern`

Allows for greater control of the resulting `<title>` element by specifying a
pattern with some special tokens.  This can be used to extend the layout's title
with the content's one, instead of simply overriding it.

Check out the [Configuring your Title](docs/examples/index.md#configuring-your-title)
example for how to control the final title of your page.
